Screen Capture and Edit for Alfred / Alfred 2
============
> Updated for Alfred 2 workflows

Created this little productivity saver to help write documentation. I'm not a fan of having an app just sitting in the menu bar... not to mention most of the features are built right into the OS. 

All this workflow is just a list of a few simple terminal commands so you can take screen capture/shot from [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com/) and edit them in Preview. 

######Requirments:
 1. [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/#download) (free)
 2. [Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) (Â£17)
